				Observations: Phase I stimulus is data of some sort that enables team-members to diverge into the unknown.   Design thinking is human-centered so this data typically takes the form of video of human behavior and/or story-telling.  Team members diverge into the unknown through one-on-one interaction with the un-mediated, raw, real data as presented on the platform.  Phase I exercises help team-members make observations of the unknown.  The goal of these exercises is to identify the "what" of human behavior.  What are people doing, what are people saying, what are people feeling, what are people thinking, what are people experiencing.  People can vote on observations so you can see what is rising.  All observations are posted and tagged for use in the next phase.

				Value is the human interpretation of a product or service to satisfy needs in particular situations. Value is at its core a subjective determination, and is inseparable from the underlying needs through which it has been determined. Entrepreneur Steve Jobs once said, "You‘ve got to start with the customer experience and work back toward the technology - not the other way around." Following his advice, we begin our problem solving process by understanding the people we want to create value for. We use this understanding to connect their values with better products and services.
				To understand what it is that people value, we must understand the way they see their world — themselves, their needs, their relationships, their fears and their hopes. We must explore what we call the "Microdepth Perspective."™ To do this, we visit with them them in their everyday environments, often in their homes or places of work. This approach cuts through evasive and pat explanations and helps uncover hidden meaning and motivations, some of which people may not be fully aware. We employ a number of proven rapport-building and information-eliciting tactics throughout our visits. We listen, watch, experience, and develop rapport. We build empathy. We note context. We uncover desires, needs and aspirations. We reach the depth necessary to reveal their "internal narrative," enabling us to understand what it is that they truly value.
				Putting these two perspectives together, we are able to build a rich insight framework for understanding customers and creating products and services that they value.

			  <p>Phase II stimulus is the observations made in the previous phase.  The exercise for this phase uses analytical tools to assist in affinitizing the observations into related clusters.  You can look at the highest rated observations.  A guided tutorial helps team-members create new insights based on these clusters.  Insight is in the first person and cites various observations.  Insights are posted and tagged for use in the next phase.</p>

				<p>Phase III stimulus consists of each of the insights from the previous phase. The exercise consists of a guided tutorial that helps team-members generate numerous opportunity areas and/or ideas for each of the insights.  Ideas are posted and tagged for use in the next phase.</p>

				<p>Phase IV stimulus consists of ideas.  Once again we affinitize the ideas into related clusters of action.  The exercise consists of a guided tutorial that helps team-members articulate the technological and business constraints that accompany each idea.  Finally, team-members can suggest areas of experimentation and/or action.</p>

				<p>Technology has advanced to the point that we can realize benefits from teamwork that were difficult to achieve even just a few years ago.  Basecamp Insights lets you leverage these advances into advantages in several ways.</p>

				<h4>Engage team members more fully</h4>

				<p>When we are tasked with innovating, we need to build on a deep understanding of the end user’s perspective.  We can’t rely on someone else’s insight to inform and motivate us.  We need to find out for ourselves—and to do that, we need to engage with the end user.</p>

				<p>The HD video we use in Basecamp Insights brings this experience directly to your team members.  There is something riveting about hearing and seeing someone tell his or her own story.  Body language, nuanced gestures, the content of the narrative, and style of the delivery all draw us in.  As we watch and listen, we come to appreciate the issues and emotions that underlie the story.</p>

				<p>In some ways, participating via Basecamp Insights is even more engaging than in person, since team members have control over the action.  They can pause and rewind to review a comment that seemed unclear, revisit moments that others have commented on, and so forth.</p>

				<h4>Cover more ground more quickly</h4>

				<p>Hearing one person’s in-depth story is a useful exercise, but hearing from two or three individuals is even better.  After you’ve heard a dozen members of a group share their stories, clear patterns of thought, behavior, emotion, and narrative construction emerge.  But few people have time to listen attentively to twelve people at three hours each.  The collaborative nature of Basecamp Insights solves this problem by making it possible to “team-source” observations by dividing up the work.</p>

				<p>Team members can be assigned a portion of the total footage to review rather than the video record in its entirety.  As they do so, they record comments on what they’re learning—comments that are viewable by other team members and contain automatic links to the pertinent portion of the video.  In this way, each member gains in-depth experience with one or two videos, and can quickly get an overview look at the others by reviewing his or her colleagues’ observations.  The stage is then set for a useful post-viewing meeting that can meaningfully address observations and lay the groundwork for insight development.  This approach brings all team members up to speed rapidly.</p>

				<h4>Consider multiple perspectives more clearly</h4>

				<p>When team members from distinct backgrounds see an issue differently, it can be hard to know how much of that difference is due to varied experience, discrete philosophical approaches, or other factors.  This lack of clarity influences how individuals contribute to group discussions.  It can make us hesitant to speak up (lest we appear to be naïve, or perhaps egocentric) and can cause us to undervalue statements made by other group members (e.g. “She just thinks that because she’s a lawyer”).</p>

				<p>Basecamp Insights helps fight these tendencies in two ways: First, contributing observations and providing feedback to others on one’s own, outside of a face-to-face group setting, is a less stressful exercise that permits freer participation.  Second, with the video footage we create a common point of reference.  This allows team members to set aside concerns about their relative backgrounds and engage.  Differences that then emerge are more likely to be driven by distinct perceptions that need to be considered by the team.</p>
